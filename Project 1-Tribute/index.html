        <p class="para">
         <b>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b> (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11
          September 1948) was a barrister, politician, and the founder of
          Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League
          from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then
          as the Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general until his
          death.By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the
          subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the possible
          marginalised status they may might be reduced to in an independent
          Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah,
          passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian
          Muslims. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while
          leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the provincial
          elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats
          reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League
          could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the entirety
          of British India to be united as a single state following
          independence, leading all parties to agree instead to the independence
          of a Hindu-majority India, and for a predominantly Muslim state of
          Pakistan.
